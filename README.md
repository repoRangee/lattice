# Well-Formed HTML Document Lab

How do we keep all of our HTML in the right places? By making sure we build the structure correctly from the very first line. Let's construct an entire HTML document to practice putting the necessary elements where they belong.

## Students will be able to ...

1. Add an appropriate `doctype` tag at the top of an HTML file
2. Enclose the HTML contents of a site inside `html` tags
3. Structure an HTML document with `head` and `body` tags
4. Add `title` tags to give the page a title that will show up in the browser
   tab

## Adding the HTML Tags

Open `index.html` in your text editor. Add a `doctype` declaration at the top of the
file indicating that the rest of the file will be HTML code. Then create
opening and closing `html` tags to enclose the remainder of your page's
content. Add opening and closing `head` and `body` tags within the outer
`html` tags to break your HTML document up into two sections. Remember, the
`head` section generally contains data intended for the web browser, and the
`body` section contains the content our users will see and interact with on the
page.

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn`. Make sure you save the file
before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error
messages that you can use to debug your code — read them closely for hints!

## Viewing Your Work in the Browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the
terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your
browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual
layout in the browser. For reference, here's a guide to [viewing HTML pages in
the Learn IDE](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/common-ide-questions/viewing-
html-pages-in-the-learn-ide).

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it
in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the
changes instantly.

## Conclusion

We've figured out how to construct a solid structure for the HTML document. Now, as you pick up new HTML tags, you'll be able to add more elements to build out the rest of the page.
